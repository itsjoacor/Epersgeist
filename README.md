## About
This project focuses on the implementation of persistence strategies, using a model of spirits and demons, on which specific information must be persisted and managed.

## Technologies
Java is used for the system logic implementation, supported by technologies like Hibernate and Spring for data persistence. The data is stored in MySQL, Neo4j, and MongoDB for different purposes.

## More
The project allows exploration of the capabilities of multiple databases and best practices for persistence in complex systems. Different types of databases were handled to understand their differences and importance.
